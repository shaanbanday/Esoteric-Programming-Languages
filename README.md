# Esoteric Programming Languages

This repository is a personal collection of experimental programs written in **esoteric programming languages** â€” niche, unconventional, or intentionally obscure languages that explore the boundaries of programming logic, minimalism, and absurdity.

Created as an exercise in abstraction and computational theory.
